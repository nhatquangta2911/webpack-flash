Bared Bone Webpack Project

***

I find it really hard to up-to-date all of the things which develops super fast.
So, a bared bone for webpack project is actually helpful for the next usages (especially in react project later on)

!!! It need more stuff in css-loader and sass-loader (in the next commits).

***

Notice: Make sure to use this command 'npm install' after configuring all of the modules!
